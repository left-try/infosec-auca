### 1. **Email Protection**

Most phishing starts with email, so the best place to stop it is **before it reaches you**.

- **Use filters and protection tools.**
    
    Email systems like Gmail, Outlook, or company filters can detect suspicious senders or fake links.
    
    They check for things like “look-alike” domains (for example, `g00gle.com` instead of `google.com`).
    
- **SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.**
    
    These are security rules added to company emails to prove messages are real.
    
    If a hacker pretends to send mail from a real company, these rules can detect and block it.
    
- **Think before you click.**
    
    Even if an email looks urgent, **hover your mouse** over the link and check if the website looks strange or fake.
    
    Example: `https://secure-bank-login.com` (fake) vs `https://bank.com` (real).
    

### 2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

Even if someone steals your password, MFA keeps your account safe.

- When you log in, MFA asks for another proof — like a code from your phone or fingerprint.
- This way, hackers can’t get in even if they trick you into giving your password.
- Always turn on MFA for your **email**, **bank**, and **school** accounts.

### 3. **User Awareness & Training**

People are often the weakest link — training fixes that.

- Schools and companies can do **phishing simulations** — safe fake emails used for practice.
- Learn to spot red flags:
    - “Your account will be closed in 1 hour!” (urgency)
    - Misspellings or strange grammar
    - Unknown sender or file attachments
- Always report suspicious messages to your teacher or IT staff.

### 4. **Website & Network Protection**

Some phishing attacks send users to fake websites.

- **Use HTTPS** — secure websites always have a lock icon before the address.
- **Don’t enter passwords** on sites that look strange, even if they have logos.
- Schools or companies can use **firewalls** and **web filters** that block known phishing sites.

### 5. **Incident Response (What to Do If It Happens)**

If someone clicks a phishing link or enters data — act fast!

1. **Change your password immediately.**
2. **Tell your IT support or teacher.**
3. **Check accounts for strange activity.**
4. If you reused that password somewhere else — change it there too.

Quick reaction can stop a small mistake from becoming a big problem.

### 6. **Awareness Campaigns**

- Post reminders like:
    - “Don’t trust links you didn’t expect.”
    - “No real bank will ask for your password by email.”
- Use posters, quick quizzes, or short talks to remind people regularly.
