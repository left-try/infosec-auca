### Identify cases where improper permissions can cause security vulnerabilities

**Examples:**

**Situation	Risk**

File with chmod 777	Everyone can edit or delete it, including attackers.
/etc/passwd writable by all users	System accounts can be changed â€” critical risk.
Scripts with 777	Malicious users can replace code or run harmful commands.
World-readable private files (chmod 644)	Sensitive information may leak (passwords, configs).

**Conclusion:**

Too open permissions make it easy for unauthorized users to read or change important files.

### Importance of Permission Auditing and Least-Privilege


**Permission Auditing:**

Regularly checking file and directory permissions helps find unsafe configurations early.
System administrators can use commands like find / -perm 777 to locate risky files and fix them.

**Least-Privilege Principle:**

Every user or process should only have the minimum permissions required for their job.
This reduces the damage that can happen if an account is compromised or misused.

**In short:**

Good permission management = safer system.
Auditing + least privilege keeps data protected and prevents accidental or intentional harm.
